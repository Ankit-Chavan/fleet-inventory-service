Fleet-Inventory-service


Project description
Fleet Inventory Service is a scalable Spring Boot microservice for managing vehicle inventory, automated allocation, and utilization forecasting. It exposes secure REST APIs to manage inventory and allocations, uses optimized in-memory and persistent data structures for high-throughput allocation decisions, and includes a pluggable ML predictor to forecast vehicle usage and improve allocation efficiency. The service is production-ready with metrics, DB migrations, and Docker support for easy deployment.
